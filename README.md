# 📊 Customer Churn Dashboard – Excel-Based Data Analysis

This project showcases a business-focused dashboard analyzing **customer churn behavior** using Microsoft Excel. Designed for recruiters and hiring managers, it highlights my ability to extract insights from raw data, use PivotTables and calculated fields, and present findings in a clear, visual format.

## 🔍 Project Summary

- **Objective:** Identify key drivers of churn and highlight trends by customer demographics, plan type, and data usage  
- **Tools Used:** Microsoft Excel 2016  
- **Techniques:** PivotTables, calculated fields, grouped bins, stacked/clustered charts, and conditional formatting

## 📈 Key Metrics

| Metric              | Value   |
|---------------------|---------|
| Total Customers     | 6,687   |
| Churned Customers   | 1,796   |
| Overall Churn Rate  | 26.86%  |

## 💡 Key Insights

- **Top Churn Drivers:**  
  Customers most frequently cited **competitor offers** and **device quality** as reasons for leaving

- **Demographic Trends:**  
  Senior customers (especially ages **79–88**) have the **highest churn rate at 43.80%**

- **Plan & Usage Behavior:**  
  Customers on **unlimited data plans** who use **less than 5GB/month** churn at the highest rate — potentially due to perceived value mismatch
